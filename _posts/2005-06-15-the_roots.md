at the Grand on June 15th, 2005.

Easily worst show of the year! I&#8217;m not sure Roots will be able to redeem themselves after this. I can&#8217;t imagine a worse way to sell out than being sponsored by a cigarette company. The entire event was just an excuse to push Kool&#8217;s cigarettes. They were everywhere! The projection screens (which usually show cool visuals) constantly showed hip people doing hip things&#8230; smoking Kools. Typically, I don&#8217;t mind advertisements, but this was a major turnoff. To make things worse, the sound was god awful. It&#8217;s like the sound guy had no idea what he was doing.

My suggestion: Skip the roots! Especially on this Kools-sponsored tour.
