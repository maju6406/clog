at Bimbos 365 Club.

So yeah, I saw the same act 3 nights in a row, and it was unbelievable. I wish I had some pictures, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, Bimbo&#8217;s are quite assholes when it comes to cameras. It&#8217;s a shame too because because it&#8217;s my favorite venue in the city.

At least I got the set list for the first night.
