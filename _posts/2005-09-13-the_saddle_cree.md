So I went to Chicago for work, and saw a few good shows. First up is the Saddle Creek Love Fest: basically a bunch of bands on the Saddle Creek and Team Love labels. It included David Dondero, Orenda Fink, Neva Dinova, and Tilly and the Walls. Quite a jam packed fun show at this place called the Abbey Pub in Chicago.  


Even more photos!
