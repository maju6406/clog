The last show of the year. It was a pretty good show to end the year with. It was also to end the year at the same venue I started the year with (full circle, ooh ahh). I didn&#8217;t have my camera, but my friend Fan took a few pictures. I thought the show actually worked better with ear plugs. It allowed me to hear Zach&#8217;s voice much better
