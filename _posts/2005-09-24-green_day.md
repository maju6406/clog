at SBC Park on Saturday, September 24th 2005.

After years of bad mouthing stadium shows withougt ever having gone to one, I went to see Green Day at SBC Park&#8230; and it was fantastic. Billie Joe is amazing front man, and they did a great job entertaining the entire crowd. It didn&#8217;t hurt to have know someone who toured with green Day who got me backstage passes. Didn&#8217;t have the camera this time- just the camera phone.
