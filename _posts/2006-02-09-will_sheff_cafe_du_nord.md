The second in my awesomely crappy Camera Phone picture series for a great show! It was kind of a boring bleak show. My favorite part was when he said &#8220;Ok, that ends the Anti-Valentine&#8217;s sentiment for the evening. Now onto more sunny happy songs! This song is about decay.&#8221; He then proceeds to sing a song about a corpse in a coffin. Uplifting!
