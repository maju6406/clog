at the Mezzanine on August 28th, 2006.

First kinda disappointing show of the year (suppose there&#8217;s gotta be at least one). I had high expectations for this one from what I had heard and seen before. Unfortunately the show was a little pricey and not nearly as grand as I hoped. Th show as theatrical with costumes, and dancers and the whole bit but the stage wasn&#8217;t large enough. Plus it was a little too much &#8220;scene&#8221; for my taste. It won&#8217;t stop me from seeing them again though.
