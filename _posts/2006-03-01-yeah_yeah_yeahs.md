at Bimbo&#8217;s 365 club on.

Bimbo&#8217;s is a great place to see a show, but unfortunately they are Nazi&#8217;s when it comes to sneaking cameras in. I&#8217;ve almost gotten kicked out twice so I stopped trying to take pictures there. This is the best pic I found on flickr for the show I went to (Thanks spangley!). The show was amazing even though it was almost all new material. That didn&#8217;t stop me from singing along to all the songs.
