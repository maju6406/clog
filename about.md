Hi there. My name is Abir Majumdar, and I live in the wonderful town of San Francisco. I love going to shows. My clog is my own personal concert diary, a place to reminisce about the shows I&#8217;ve been to over the years and a place where I can share pictures, videos, and music with other fans. I hope you enjoy it. If you have any questions or want to share your own experiences, email me at <beersy@gmail.com>.
